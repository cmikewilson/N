My first real program.
It shows a Japanese word or phrase and asks for the pronunciation
and you choose its definition from a list of options.

I was proud of the double buffered VGA graphics.
When I was later learned C, where pointers were presented as a boogieman,
I was pleased to realize that they were just addresses.

Written for use with the A86 assembler, a shareware assembler of the time.
